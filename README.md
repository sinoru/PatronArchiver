## Features

- **Multi-format archives** — each post is saved as a PDF, an MHTML web archive, and individual media files in a single folder
- **Fully offline** — all archives live on your device; no account or internet connection required to re-read them
- **Complete capture** — text, images, videos, attachments, and comments, including lazy-loaded content
- **Auto-organized** — posts are grouped by creator and title; Finder tags and origin URLs are written as filesystem metadata (visible in Finder on Mac)
- **iPhone, iPad, and Mac** — archive on any of your Apple devices

## Privacy

PatronArchiver does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data. There are no analytics, advertising SDKs, or trackers. All archived content is stored exclusively on your device. The app uses an embedded `WKWebView` to access creator platform websites; cookies set during sign-in are stored locally within that web view and are sent only to their originating sites.
